That's me.

I'm a Design Engineer, most specifically a Designer / Software Engineer. I love working with HTML and CSS, and I have special interest in creating and mantaining the code part of design systems. That's exactly what my team and I do at LoanPro, and that makes me very happy.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I'm probably cooking, baking bread, or [having fun with these people](https://www.instagram.com/p/CACQTU1HBKD/).


## Other stuff I'm into:

- Podcasts. I listen to a few of them, [I used to have one](https://rancherostiernos.com), and [I also produce another one](https://ferulita.com).
- Music. I'm learning how to play, and I also collect records.
- Woodworking. It all started with YouTube videos during the covid lockdown.
- Stickers. I love them! In my previous job I was the sticker guy, and I kinda miss it.
- I'm working in a fanzine right now. More about that soon. The web is more practical, but nothing beats the feeling of a paper zine. Also, there's a full conversation there about self-publishing, the DIY movement and underground press. Hopefully that will start some interesting blog posts.

That's me.

I'm a mix of designer and front-end software engineer, and that's why I call myself a Design Engineer. I love working with HTML and CSS, and I have special interest in creating and mantaining the technical side of design systems.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I'm probably cooking, baking bread, or having fun with my wife and kids.

I'm trying to get away from social media and other attention-hijacking engines we're too used to. Part of those efforts are reflected in this website, where I try to have an "old fashioned" web presence, owning and controlling my own data.


## Other stuff I'm into:

- Podcasts. I listen to a few of them, [I used to have one](https://rancherostiernos.com), and [I also produce another one](https://ferulita.com). Both in spanish.
- Music. I'm learning how to play, and I also collect records.
- Woodworking. It all started with YouTube videos during the covid lockdown, right now I'm building small stuff for my family and me, but my skill doesn't yet met my taste.
- I'm working in a fanzine right now. More about that soon. The web is more practical, but nothing beats the feeling of a paper zine. Also, there's a full conversation there about self-publishing, the DIY movement and underground press.

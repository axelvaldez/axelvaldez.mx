Yesterday I launched the website for one of my podcasts, [Ferulita para el Alma](https://ferulita.com) (in Spanish). During the long weekend here in Mexico I hacked a bunch of stuff together to build the site automatically from the podcast RSS feed, and it worked!

[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) is awesome, and the nerd community sharing their how-tos more so ♥️.

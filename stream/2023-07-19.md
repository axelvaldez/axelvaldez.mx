Today I started the bargaining stage of quitting nicotine. I've found myself considering how bad will it be to be back. If the health benefits, the independence and freedom of not being tied to nic devices are even worth it against a sweet nicotine buzz. If I can be back *only occasionally*.

I have a very toxic relationship with nicotine, both literally and figuratively.

After a relapse of six-seven months, I'm quitting nicotine for the second time in my life. Shit's hard.

I don't feel any physical manifestations, other than the impulse to look for the vape every 2 minutes, but I'm on the verge of an emotional breakdown at every moment.

Hopefully, this will be just a couple of days.

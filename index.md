I’m a design engineer with 20+ years of experience creating and maintaining websites and user interfaces for all kind of software applications.

I currently lead the UI Engineering team at <a href="https://loanpro.io">LoanPro</a>, crafting loan management, servicing and collections software with focus on automation and data visibility. Before that, I was a design engineer at <a href="https://encora.com">Encora México</a> (formerly Nearsoft), where I led the development of marketing websites based on WordPress, Hubspot and Jekyll, all across design, development, deployment and maintenance.

I am a design engineer with over 20 years of experience creating and managing websites and user interfaces for a diverse range of software applications. I currently head the UI Engineering team at [LoanPro](https://loanpro.io), helping develop cutting-edge loan management, servicing, and collections software that emphasizes automation and data visibility.

Prior to my current role, I served as a design engineer at [Encora](https://encora.com) (formerly Nearsoft), where I led the development of marketing websites using WordPress, Hubspot, and Jekyll. I managed all aspects of the design, development, deployment, and maintenance phases to ensure seamless, high-quality outcomes.

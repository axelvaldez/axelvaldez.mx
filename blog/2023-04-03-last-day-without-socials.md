Today is the last day of my 30 days without social media. These are some bullet points of my experience:

<!-- more -->

- The first two weeks were hell. I constantly reached for my phone and got frustrated. The fear of missing out (FOMO) was strong, but after two weeks, it was mostly gone.
- I socialized a lot more in person: I went to the bar, invited friends over, and visited, too.
- I got a feel for who is in my true immediate circle of people.
- I didn't miss Twitter or BeReal too much after two weeks, but I kinda missed peeking into friends' and acquaintances' lives through Instagram.
- I read a lot more and also watched more TV.
- I reactivated my personal website and started writing again. If I had to choose one good thing only, this would be it.

I don't think I'm going back to using Twitter. I don't miss being angry about the polarized opinions of people I don't even care about. The people I do care about, I already follow on Instagram.

To be honest, I'm a little afraid of falling back into the addiction patterns and the emptiness from before. But also after thinking a lot about it, I don't think abandoning social media completely is even an option today. I need to keep the harmful dynamics of it in mind and find a balance. That's easier said than done, so I will keep tabs on it and reconsider in a couple of months.

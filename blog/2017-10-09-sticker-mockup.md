I constantly find myself looking for free PSD mockups to present work, usually for small things like stickers, mugs, or posters. Today I couldn’t find a decent one for a set of stickers, and instead of buying a premium one, I decided to scratch my own itch, make my own and share it with you.

### How to use it

Usage is fairly easy:

1. Open the file in Photoshop
2. Double click the smart object icon on the topmost layer
3. Paste the artwork of your sticker in the file that just opened
4. Save the file with your artwork and go back to the mockup image
5. …
6. Profit!

The mockup automagically adds padding to your artwork, so there’s no need to worry about that. Just copy and paste as it is.
